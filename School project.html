    <h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
    <div class="about">
        Cyber Security is the technology and process that is designed to protect networks and devices from attack, damage or unauthorised access.
    </div>
    <br>

    <h1>How cyber Security Works?</h1>
    <div class="about">
        Cybersecurity is designed to provide multiple layers of protection across all of the computers, networks, and programs used by a business. In order to create a unified defence against potential cyberattacks, it is important that the business, employees, processes, and technology are designed to work seamlessly together. Cybersecurity systems that function properly will be able to detect, investigate, and resolve potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system before they can be exploited by a hacker or malicious software.
    </div>
    <br>
    
    
    <h1>Some Types of Cyberattacks</h1>
    <div class="about">
        There are several different types of cyber attacks, some of them are:
        <ul>
        
            <li>
                <b><u>Phishing</u></b>, a type of cyberattack that involves sending a fraudulent message in an attempt to get the recipient to provide sensitive information, such as password credentials.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b><u>Malware</u></b>, which involves using viruses, spyware or other malicious software to steal information.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b><u>Ransomware</u></b>, where data is stolen and only released upon payment of ransom. However, this data typically becomes available on the dark web regardless of payment.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <b><u>DoS (denial of service) or DDoS (distributed denial of service)</u></b> attacks deny access to systems making business inoperable.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <td class="about">
                Ransomware isn't a new threat – it's been around for about two decades – but it is a growing one. It's estimated that there are now over 120 separate families of ransomware, and hackers have become very adept at hiding malicious code. <br>
                Ransomware is a type of malware in which the data on a victim's computer is locked, and payment is demanded before the ransomed data is unlocked. After successful payment, access rights returned to the victim. <br>
                Ransomware attacks are growing day by day in the areas of cybercrime. IT professionals and business leaders need to have a powerful recovery strategy against the malware attacks to protect their organization. It involves proper planning to recover corporate and customers' data and application as well as reporting any breaches against the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme. Today's DRaaS solutions are the best defence against the ransomware attacks. With DRaaS solutions method, we can automatically back up our files, easily identify which backup is clean, and launch a fail-over with the press of a button when malicious attacks corrupt our data. <br>

                Phishing Attacks
            </td>
            <td class="about">
                A phishing attack is a type of social engineering attack that targets users’ login details and credit card information. In contrast to ransomware, here the information benefits the hacker. Gmail is a Google service that is used across the board for almost everything from business to personal purposes. <br>
                Now, whenever you open your mail account, you might come across a spam folder that consists of emails that the platform recognizes as a threat to your data security. These spam emails consist of thousands of phishing attacks that your mailing partner recognizes and warns you about the potential cyber threat that it carries. Yet, some of the communications still make it to your inbox where you might fall into a trap.

                Mobile Malware
            </td>
            <td class="about">
                As mobile devices have become more widely used, mobile malware has emerged as a growing threat. Mobile malware masquerading as legitimate and harmless applications — such as QR code readers, flashlights, and games — have grown more common on official and unofficial app stores. <br>
                These attempts to infect users’ mobile devices have expanded from fake apps to cracked and custom versions of legitimate apps. Cybercriminals are offering unofficial versions of apps as malicious APKs via direct downloads and third-party app stores. These apps are designed to take advantage of name recognition to slip malware onto devices.

                Global Attacks on Business
            </td>
            <td class="about">
                Cybercrime is a problem that is rapidly growing on a global scale. In Q3 2022, global cyberattacks increased by 28% compared to the same quarter in 2021. Going into 2023, this trend is only likely to continue. A mature corporate cybersecurity program needs to be capable of defending against threats originating from all around the world. This includes comprehensive threat protection, round-the-clock monitoring, and access to up-to-date threat intelligence.
