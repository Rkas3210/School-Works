    <h1>How cyber Security Works?</h1>
    <div class="about">
        Cybersecurity is designed to provide multiple layers of protection across all of the computers, networks, and programs used by a business. In order to create a unified defence against potential cyberattacks, it is important that the business, employees, processes, and technology are designed to work seamlessly together. Cybersecurity systems that function properly will be able to detect, investigate, and resolve potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system before they can be exploited by a hacker or malicious software.

    <h1>Some Types of Cyberattacks</h1>
    <div class="about">
        There are several different types of cyber attacks which are in the following:
        <ul>
        
            <li>
                Phishing, a type of cyberattack that involves sending a fraudulent message in an attempt to get the recipient to provide sensitive information, such as password credentials.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Malware, which involves using viruses, spyware or other malicious software to steal information.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Ransomware, where data is stolen and only released upon payment of ransom. However, this data typically becomes available on the dark web regardless of payment.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                DoS (denial of service) or DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks deny access to systems making business inoperable.
            </li>
        </ul>
